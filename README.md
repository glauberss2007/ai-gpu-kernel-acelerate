## GPU Acceleration with Custom Triton Kernels

**Triton Custom Kernels** are user-defined CUDA-like functions written in Triton that allow developers to optimize specific computations beyond the built-in operations. These custom kernels are designed to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs and can be tailored for tasks such as matrix multiplication, convolution, or other operations, providing greater control over performance.

**Key features of Triton custom kernels include:**
- Easy-to-write and understand code, resembling Python.
- High performance comparable to hand-optimized CUDA kernels.
- Flexibility to customize for specific hardware and workload needs.
- Simplified development process compared to traditional CUDA programming.

## High-Performance Fused Softmax Implementation Pytorch

The softmax function is used in machine learning to convert a vector of raw scores (logits) into probabilities that sum to 1. It is commonly used in classification tasks, especially in the output layer of neural networks for multiclass classification.

### Definition:

Given a vector of scores \(\mathbf{z} = [z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_K]\), the softmax function outputs a probability distribution across \(K\) classes:

\[
\sigma(\mathbf{z})_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
\]

### Characteristics:

- **Probability Distribution:** The softmax output can be interpreted as the probability of each class. All probabilities sum up to 1.
- **Exponential Scaling:** Enhances the differences between scores, making the larger scores even more dominant.
- **Differentiable:** Suitable for gradient-based optimization.

### Applications:

- **Multiclass Classification:** Maps scores to a probability distribution over classes in the output layer of neural networks.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Used in policy gradients to model probabilities of actions.
